# Programming-Technique-I

As a fundamental subject, this course equips the students with theory and practice on problem solving techniques by using the structured approach. Students are required to develop programs using C++ programming language, in order to solve simple to moderate problems. The course covers the following: preprocessor directives, constants and variables, data types, input and output statements, control structures: sequential, selection and loop, built-in and user-defined functions, single and two dimensional arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data types.

Learning programming was fun. In addition to getting access to the computer, I frequently wrote programmes that allowed users to enter specific information. Sometimes it could be challenging, but I enjoyed figuring out how to make things work. It is great that I can now create basic programmes. I look forward to learn more and use programming to create even more amazing things!
