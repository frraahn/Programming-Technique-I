<summary>Reflection</summary>
Learning programming was fun. In addition to getting access to the computer, I frequently wrote programmes that allowed users to enter specific information. Sometimes it could be challenging, but I enjoyed figuring out how to make things work. It is great that I can now create basic programmes. I look forward to learn more and use programming to create even more amazing things!
